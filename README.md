# Software Engineer Applicant Exercise

To be considered for a Software Engineer position at [Independent Financial Partners](http://www.ifpartners.com), you must successfully complete these steps [**](#footnote)

1. Fork this repository
2. In the *why_hire_me* directory
    * Add a file `cover_letter.txt` with cover letter type verbiage.
    * Fill out the `questionnaire.txt` and commit it
    * Add anything else we should know.  For example, one of your preferred development tools (editor, desktop app, etc.) and why you use it.
3. In the *simple_collection_process* directory, using the programming language / tool of your preference, create a script that collects
the following information from the first 6 articles on our blog [here](http://ifpartners.com/cut-the-wire/) and saves it to a CSV file.
    * Datetime Updated
    * Title Header
    * If an author exists (only first author):
      * Name
    * Banner Image href
    * Content Body HTML
    * Include a copy of the CSV file generated from your run
    * Include run instructions (specify versions used)
    * Extra Credit: Download first image in content body and save to local filesystem
    * Tips
        * Write good code that you want people to see.
        * Make it easy to use
    * See [example article](http://ifpartners.com/not-using-facebook-ads-youre-lunatic/) & illustrated data points:

4. In the *simple_refactoring_exercise* directory you will find some several directories of code that needs to be refactored. Pick a language you are fluent in and refactor it. Let us know in your cover letter which language you chose.
    * Tests/specs are included.
    * Please [refactor](http://www.refactoring.com) the implementation. Clarity and duplication are a given, flawed implementation is also likely.
    * Please note: feel free to change the tests/specs, but they should all be passing when you turn in your code.
    * Leave a note about what you refactored and why.  Calling specific named smells and specific named refactorings should be the norm.    
5. Commit and Push your code to your fork
6. Send a pull request, we will review your code and get back to you. If your GitHub profile does not include your name, please include your name in the pull request.

job application task was previously done by [Hedgeye](https://app.hedgeye.com/) [here](https://github.com/hedgeyedev/Data-Engineer-Applicant-Exercise)
