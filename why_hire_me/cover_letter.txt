	This job opportunity will serve me as a well-timed opportunity to gain greater experience in the field of software development. I intend to work towards being a better engineer at that to shape my skills in the right way if I am given the opportunity.	One of the reason I want to be considered for this position is that I have the required professional experience  working with Python and Django for 2 years. I have a good grasp on Python, SQL databases, and fluent with the web technologies of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 	I have worked individually and as part of a team. I have the required communication skills to work or get the work done with minimum supervision. I believe I can handle a team or be a part of a team of diverse set of skills. I can blend in with people as this is necessary to get the work done.
	I am also dedicated to the work I do which implies I do not mind working extended hours, if needed, as I want to go home with the sense of satisfaction that I do not have to worry about something which is left incomplete.
	With all that said, I also want to learn the culture of the company and be a proud member of it. At the same time, get working on new stuff which can benefit both the company and I.NOTE - In the simple_refactoring_exercise, I have use “PYTHON” as my preferred language
